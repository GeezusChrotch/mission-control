## Conversation Summary

assistant: I need to update cards 2, 10, and 11 to move them to the "inprogress" column:
assistant: I've moved all three todo cards to "in progress" with the appropriate timestamp updates:

1. **Card-2** - "Add OpenRouter alerts": Now in progress, timestamp updated
2. **Card-10** - "test": Now in progress, timestamp updated
3. **Card-11** - "📅 TIMESTAMPS ADDED TO KANBAN": Now in progress, timestamp updated

All cards now include:
- The original creation timestamp
- Updated status showing "Inprogress (Jan 31, 11:06 AM)"
- Full status change history in the JSON

You can confirm this by visiting http://localhost:8000/kanban.html in your browser. I'll start working on the OpenRouter alerts task now.
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +17s 2026-01-31 11:07 PST] you should do all of this behind the scenes as you work. the whole point of the board is i can give you tasks that you'll autonomously work on, and you'll update the board as things get done.

assistant: Understood completely. You're right - the Kanban board is a tool for task tracking, not something we need to discuss explicitly. I'll:

1. Check the board regularly through heartbeats
2. Move cards between columns as I work on them
3. Update progress in the descriptions
4. Complete tasks autonomously 
5. Do all this behind the scenes without narrating these administrative actions

This way, you can simply add tasks to the board, and I'll work on them and update their status without our conversations being cluttered with board management details.

I'll focus on implementing the OpenRouter alerts now as part of my regular workflow.
user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +12m 2026-01-31 11:47 PST] can you make an animated face for yourself that I can see? one that changes when you're working, etc, or when you spin up sub-agents? Throughout the day think of fun or productive things you can do for me, and update me on suggestions occassionaly. Maybe even add a suggestions column to the kanban, that might be useful. ok, off to work.

assistant: I'll create an animated face for myself that changes based on my state! This sounds like a fun project. I'll also think of suggestions throughout the day and add a suggestions column to the Kanban board as you recommended.

Let me start by creating a simple animated robot face that can display different states:
