# January 31, 2026 - Updates

## Context Length Error Fix

Fixed the context length errors that were causing session restarts. Applied configuration changes:
- Enabled intelligent context pruning with 3 hour TTL
- Set memory limits to reserve 10,000 tokens for new content
- Configured soft/hard pruning thresholds to prevent overflow
- Added placeholder text for pruned content
- Applied memory flush settings at 150,000 tokens

## New Features Added

### Animated Avatar (Updated)
Created two versions of the animated avatar for Roboboogie:

1. **Interactive Demo** (`/Users/Josh/clawd/avatar/index.html`)
   - Shows different states with control buttons
   - Good for testing the visual appearance

2. **Floating Window Version** (`/Users/Josh/clawd/avatar/floating_avatar.py`)
   - Frameless, always-on-top window
   - Transparent background (only the avatar is visible)
   - Draggable by clicking and moving
   - Automatically detects Clawdbot activity:
     * Monitors session files for recent modifications
     * Transitions between states based on activity
     * Shows idle, thinking, working, excited, and subagent states

### Kanban Suggestions Column
Added a dedicated "Suggestions" column to the kanban board to track potential improvements:
- Created purple-themed column in the HTML/CSS
- Added it to the column selector dropdown
- Added sample suggestion cards for future projects

Initial suggestions:
1. Animated avatar development
2. Weekly system review automation
3. Voice character collection for storytelling

The kanban server runs at http://localhost:8000/kanban.html
