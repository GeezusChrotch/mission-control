assistant: Hey Josh! Roboboogie here 🤖 Ready to help with whatever's on your mind today.
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +28s 2026-02-03 09:22 PST] this happened, again...after your security fixes. "⚠️ Agent failed before reply: Unknown model: anthropic/claude-opus-4.5. Logs: openclaw logs --follow"
[message_id: 2614]
assistant: That's frustrating! Let me check what's happening with the model configuration.
assistant: I see the issue! The logs show that OpenClaw is trying to use `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5` but getting a 401 authentication error. This suggests the Anthropic API key isn't configured properly. Let me check the current configuration:
assistant: I can see the issue now! The configuration shows that `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` is in the fallbacks list, but there's no API key configured for Anthropic. The auth profiles show `anthropic:default` and `anthropic:manual` but they don't have API keys set.

Let me check what environment variables or API keys are available:
assistant: The issue is clear now. Looking at the logs and configuration:

1. The system is trying to use `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` as a fallback model
2. The Anthropic auth profiles exist but don't have API keys configured
3. There's no credential file for Anthropic in the credentials directory

The fix is to either:
1. Add an Anthropic API key to the configuration, or
2. Remove `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` from the fallbacks list since you don't have an Anthropic API key

Since you mentioned this happened "again" after security fixes, I recommend removing the Anthropic models from the fallbacks list since you don't have an API key configured. Would you like me to update the configuration to remove the Anthropic models from the fallbacks?
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +43s 2026-02-03 09:24 PST] let's only use openrouter models and local models
[message_id: 2619]
assistant: Perfect! I'll update the configuration to only use OpenRouter models and remove the Anthropic models from the fallbacks list.
assistant: Let me fix that by providing the raw JSON:
