assistant: Today's memories already captured:
- Mission Control proper setup following SKILL.md
- GitHub Pages + Tailscale Funnel architecture
- LiveAvatar token issues

MEMORY.md has the long-term lessons. No new durable memories to store.

assistant: Hey! What's up?
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +1m 2026-02-02 21:44 PST] let's change our brain model to kimi k2.5, our heartbeat model to haiku, and our coding model to minimax v3.2, but only if all of those are available in our config via openrouter
[message_id: 2452]
assistant: **Results:**

| Model | Available? | OpenRouter ID |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Kimi K2.5** | ✅ | `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` |
| **Haiku** | ✅ | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` |
| **MiniMax v3.2** | ❌ | Not on OpenRouter yet (only M1, M2, M2.1) |

**What's available for coding?**
- `minimax/minimax-m2.1` (current)
- `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` (same as brain model)
- `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` (cheaper/faster option)

Want me to:
1. Update default to Kimi K2.5
2. Add Haiku as a model (can use for heartbeat)
3. Keep MiniMax M2.1 for coding (no v3.2 available)

Or pick a different coding model?
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +1m 2026-02-02 21:45 PST] yes to all of that, haiku via openrouter of course for heartbeat, I think I selected it in the config, one of the versions at least.

assistant: Done! Restarting gateway for changes to take effect:


user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +1m 2026-02-02 21:49 PST] did you make those model changes? defualt kimi k2.5, heartbeat haiku 4.5, coding minimax m2.1
[message_id: 2457]
assistant: **Almost!** The default and heartbeat models are set, but coding is still routing to qwen3-coder (Ollama local) instead of MiniMax M2.1. Let me fix:


assistant: Done! Changed coding from Ollama qwen to MiniMax M2.1. Restarting gateway:
