## Conversation Summary

assistant: **Done.** Cron job updated:

- **When**: Every day at 6:00 AM PST
- **Where**: iMessage (jbessom@me.com) **AND** Telegram
- **What**: Full briefing per HEARTBEAT.md — weather, both calendars, email subjects, tasks, OpenRouter costs, and news

Tomorrow morning you'll get it on **both** channels. No more "let's see if it works" — it's locked in.

Now I just need to fix that OpenRouter auth so costs show up too.
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +41s 2026-02-03 12:57 PST] actually you missed an all day event on the work calendar
[message_id: 2737]
assistant: What's the event? clippy is showing "No events scheduled" — might be an auth issue or the event is on a calendar I can't see.
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +27s 2026-02-03 12:57 PST] it's a google calendar, the w2w calendar on google is my work schedule, it has an all day event
[message_id: 2739]
assistant: I see events starting Feb 5-8 but nothing on Feb 3. What event should be there? (Might be a sync delay or different calendar.)
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +40s 2026-02-03 12:59 PST] actually it's the LMT VOps calendar. That and W2W are my two work calendars.
[message_id: 2741]
assistant: Found it! **"Show#3 - Sweeney Todd"** — multi-day event Jan 20 - Feb 23 on LMT VOps calendar.

Updating HEARTBEAT.md to check **both** work calendars:
assistant: **Corrected briefing:**
