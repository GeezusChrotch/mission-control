user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +26s 2026-02-01 21:26 PST] i'm seeing function calls in the chat, that's wrong
[message_id: 1879]
assistant: Sorry about that! The function calls weren't supposed to show up. 

About my avatar - I checked and the IDENTITY.md file shows my avatar field is currently empty. We never actually created or selected one. Did you have an image in mind you'd like to use as my avatar? I could help find one or generate something appropriate!

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
