## Ollama Integration Attempt
- **Goal**: Set up local llama3.2:3b for zero-cost heartbeats
- **Status**: Configuration applied but not fully tested
- **Issues**: Multiple attempts to configure Ollama provider in openclaw.json
- **Lesson**: Need to be more careful with config changes - broke gateway twice
- **Current Config**: 
  - Provider: ollama at http://localhost:11434/v1
  - Model: llama3.2:3b for heartbeats
  - Auto-start LaunchAgent created for Ollama

## Key Reminder
Before making config changes:
1. Research the exact format needed
2. Create backups
3. Validate before restarting
4. Test incrementally

## Josh's Feedback
- "Research how to do something before you make changes"
- "Don't break things badly by guessing"
- Use Perplexity or docs for research first
