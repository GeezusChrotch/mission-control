## Model Aliases Added
- Configured short aliases for all 11 models in openclaw.json:
  - `kimi` → openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
  - `claude4` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
  - `claude37` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
  - `claude35` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
  - `opus` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.5
  - `haiku` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
  - `grok` → openrouter/x-ai/grok-4
  - `deepseek` → openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2
  - `minimax` → openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.1
  - `llama` → ollama/llama3.2:3b
  - `qwen` → ollama/qwen3-coder:30b

## Llama Heartbeat Working
- Verified ollama/llama3.2:3b is working for heartbeat (every 30 min)
- Main session stays on Kimi K2.5 via OpenRouter
- This saves OpenRouter credits for actual work

## GitHub Backup
- Committed 3 memory files (79 insertions)
- Pushed to origin/main

## Browser Profile Added
- Created new browser profile `openclaw-chrome` on port 18801
- Launched Chrome with isolated user data dir for accessing gateway Control UI
- Gateway token: `c42c95ffb81c515fd5ef4a4ff44ade352a654a674e1c9eca`

## Clippy Keepalive Issue
- Changed interval from 10 seconds to 10 minutes (600s)
- **Problem**: keepalive command opens interactive Outlook windows instead of running headless
- Multiple Outlook windows kept popping up repeatedly
- **Solution**: Killed all keepalive processes, unloaded LaunchAgent (`com.clippy.keepalive.plist`)
- **Status**: Keepalive disabled. Clippy will work on-demand (may take extra second to refresh token)
- **Lesson**: Clippy keepalive doesn't work headless — only use it when actively using Clippy

## Misc
- Josh primarily uses Comet browser but needs Chrome for OpenClaw web UI
- Gateway auth working now (token can be reused across browser windows)
