## Model Aliases Added
- Configured short aliases for all 11 models in openclaw.json:
  - `kimi` → openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
  - `claude4` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
  - `claude37` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet
  - `claude35` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
  - `opus` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.5
  - `haiku` → openrouter/anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
  - `grok` → openrouter/x-ai/grok-4
  - `deepseek` → openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2
  - `minimax` → openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.1
  - `llama` → ollama/llama3.2:3b
  - `qwen` → ollama/qwen3-coder:30b

## Llama Heartbeat Working
- Verified ollama/llama3.2:3b is working for heartbeat (every 30 min)
- Main session stays on Kimi K2.5 via OpenRouter
- This saves OpenRouter credits for actual work

## GitHub Backup
- Committed 3 memory files (79 insertions)
- Pushed to origin/main

## Browser Profile Added
- Created new browser profile `openclaw-chrome` on port 18801
- Launched Chrome with isolated user data dir for accessing gateway Control UI
- Gateway token: `c42c95ffb81c515fd5ef4a4ff44ade352a654a674e1c9eca`

## Clippy Keepalive Issue
- Changed interval from 10 seconds to 10 minutes (600s)
- **Problem**: keepalive command opens interactive Outlook windows instead of running headless
- Multiple Outlook windows kept popping up repeatedly
- **Solution**: Killed all keepalive processes, unloaded LaunchAgent (`com.clippy.keepalive.plist`)
- **Status**: Keepalive disabled. Clippy will work on-demand (may take extra second to refresh token)
- **Lesson**: Clippy keepalive doesn't work headless — only use it when actively using Clippy

## Tailscale Gateway Access Fixed
- **Problem**: Couldn't connect to gateway via Tailscale URL (dm-studio.tail43f9ee.ts.net:18789)
- **Issues found**: 
  - Tailscale mode was "off" in config
  - Control UI device auth was blocking access
- **Solutions**:
  - Enabled `gateway.tailscale.mode: "serve"`
  - Disabled device auth: `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth: true`
  - Set `allowInsecureAuth: true` for Control UI
- **Result**: Gateway now accessible from any device on tailnet using token auth
- **Security**: Token-only auth is fine for tailnet-only access (no public internet exposure)

## UI Theming
- Changed `ui.seamColor` to green (#00AA55) for chat interface
- Tried to theme Control UI but it's hardcoded — no config options available
- Josh will use Noir browser extension to customize Control UI colors

## Bedtime Story
- Josh sent voice message: "Tell me a bedtime story"
- Transcribed using Whisper (local, no API key)
- Responded with "The Tale of the Digital Lobster" — a story about Clawrence the helpful lobster who lives in the Server Sea

## Morning Voice Briefing Setup
- **Request**: Josh wants voice briefing at 6 AM on Bedroom Speaker for him and Jane
- **Script created**: `morning-voice-briefing.sh`
  - Gets weather for Buena Park (current temp, high/low)
- **Device**: Bedroom Speaker (found via `atvremote scan`)
- **TTS**: sag (ElevenLabs) with "Roger" voice (laid-back, casual, resonant)
- **Cron job**: `9dec0fcf-d786-419b-8e00-adb91e6e312b` — runs daily at 6 AM PT
- **API Key**: Had to update ElevenLabs key (old one revoked)
- **Test**: Successfully played weather briefing on Bedroom Speaker
- **Existing**: Text morning briefing still goes to Telegram + iMessage at 6 AM

## Misc
- Josh primarily uses Comet browser but needs Chrome for OpenClaw web UI
- Gateway auth working now (token can be reused across browser windows)
- Control UI URL: http://127.0.0.1:18789
- Tailscale URL: https://dm-studio.tail43f9ee.ts.net:18789/
- Token: `c42c95ffb81c515fd5ef4a4ff44ade352a654a674e1c9eca`
