# 2026-02-02 - Mission Control Setup & Model Changes

## Session Summary
Evening session with Josh getting Mission Control operational and updating AI model configuration.

## Model Configuration Changes
Updated OpenClaw config with new model routing:
- **Default model**: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` (switched from MiniMax M2.1)
- **Heartbeat model**: `openrouter/anthropic/haiku-4.5` (dedicated lightweight model for periodic checks)
- **Coding preference**: MiniMax M2.1 still available on request (cheaper option)

Josh prefers Kimi K2.5 for general use due to quality, will specify when he wants the cheaper MiniMax model for coding tasks.

## Mission Control Skill Setup
Migrated from old self-built kanban to proper Mission Control skill:

### What Was Done
- Found old kanban tasks in `kanban/kanban.json` (21 tasks)
- Current `data/tasks.json` only had sample/guide tasks
- Created migration script `scripts/migrate-kanban.js`
- Successfully migrated all 21 historical tasks
- Organized by project type: default, suggestions, ideas, guides

### Current Task State
- **24 total tasks** (3 guide tasks + 21 migrated)
- **18 done** - Historical completed work
- **4 backlog** - Ready to work on
- **2 permanent** - Guide/reference tasks

### Backlog Tasks Requiring Attention
1. 🤖 Auto-OpenRouter Balance Check - Daily balance logging script
2. 📊 Daily Cost Summary Script - API spend tracking (script exists, needs cron)
3. 📝 Auto-Daily Summary - Auto-generate memory entries from kanban changes
4. Example Task - Sample/demo task

### Issues Found
- CLI script (`mc-update.sh`) has incorrect path - looks for tasks in skill directory instead of workspace
- Webhook not yet tested - unclear if task moves trigger notifications to me
- Dashboard live at: https://GeezusChrotch.github.io/mission-control/

## Technical Notes
- Gateway restarted successfully after config patch
- Git push worked, GitHub Pages should update
- Need to fix CLI paths for proper task management

## Next Steps (From Session)
- Fix CLI script paths
- Test webhook functionality
- Potentially work on backlog tasks (balance check, cost summary, auto-daily summary)
