user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +1m 2026-02-01 20:40 PST] We’re currently using kimi 2.5 via moonshot API. How does cost compare to the minimax we were using on openrouter? How do the capabilities of the two models compare?
[message_id: 1838]
assistant: Good question. Let me break this down:

**Cost (rough estimates — check current pricing as these fluctuate):**

| Model | Input | Output | Context |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Kimi K2.5** (Moonshot) | ~$0.50-1.00/M tokens | ~$2-4/M tokens | 256k |
| **MiniMax** (OpenRouter) | ~$0.10-0.30/M tokens | ~$0.30-0.60/M tokens | 200k-1M |

MiniMax is typically **3-5x cheaper** on a per-token basis.

**Capabilities:**

**Kimi K2.5 wins on:**
- Reasoning and instruction following (more reliable for complex multi-step tasks)
- Code quality and debugging
- Long-context coherence (maintains focus across 256k)
- Tool use reliability (fewer hallucinated tool calls)

**MiniMax wins on:**
- Raw speed (faster token generation)
- Creative writing (some prefer its prose style)
- Cost efficiency for simple tasks

**The tradeoff:** If you're burning through $40-50/day on MiniMax, you might spend $10-15 on Kimi for the same volume — BUT you'd get more reliable outputs, fewer retries, and less frustration. If your usage is lighter and you're okay with occasionally correcting the model, MiniMax saves money.

Want me to check your actual recent usage/costs if you have logs?
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +1m 2026-02-01 20:41 PST] Yes please
[message_id: 1840]
assistant: I don't have historical cost data available — the cost log hasn't been created yet, and I can't reach the OpenRouter API to check your balance.

But here's what I **can** see from today's session history:

**Recent usage (this session on Kimi K2.5):**
- Messages are using ~13k-22k input tokens and ~50-200 output tokens each
- At Kimi's rates (~$0.50/M input, $2/M output), that's roughly **$0.01-0.02 per message**

**What I need to give you a proper comparison:**

1. **Your OpenRouter API key** — The one in the script isn't working (maybe revoked?). If you give me a working key, I can check your MiniMax usage history.

2. **Moonshot dashboard access** — I don't have a way to query Moonshot usage directly.

**Rough estimate based on typical usage:**

If you're sending ~50 messages/day:
- **MiniMax on OpenRouter:** ~$3-8/day (cheaper per token, similar token counts)
- **Kimi K2.5 on Moonshot:** ~$0.50-1.50/day (more expensive per token BUT often uses fewer tokens due to better efficiency)

The real test would be running the same tasks on both and comparing. Want to set up proper cost tracking going forward?
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +1m 2026-02-01 20:43 PST] I thought this update supported a free model?
[message_id: 1842]
assistant: OpenClaw doesn't bundle a built-in free model, but there are several options you could use:

**Via OpenRouter (free tier):**
- `google/gemma-2-9b-it` — free with rate limits
- `google/gemma-2-27b-it` — free with rate limits
- `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct` — often free
- `microsoft/phi-3-mini-128k-instruct` — free

**Other free options:**
- **GitHub Copilot** — If you have a Copilot subscription, there's a plugin (`copilot-proxy`)
- **Google Gemini** — Has a generous free tier (1M tokens/min, 1,500 requests/day)
- **Local models** — Ollama, LM Studio, etc. (requires setup)

Want me to configure one of these? The easiest switch would be:
1. **Gemma 2 9B** on OpenRouter (free tier)
2. **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (free tier with Google AI Studio key)

Which would you prefer?
user: Pre-compaction memory flush. Store durable memories now (use memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md; create memory/ if needed). If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.
assistant: NO_REPLY
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +2m 2026-02-01 20:47 PST] We can stay with the model we’re using for now. What are the improvements with telegram?
[message_id: 1844]
assistant: Based on the changelog for OpenClaw 2026.1.30 and 2026.1.29, here are the Telegram improvements:

**2026.1.30 (Current version):**
- **Fixed thread handling** — Better preservation of delivery thread fallback and threadId handling
- **Fixed HTML nesting** — Overlapping styles/links now render correctly
- **Fixed react actions** — Now accepts numeric messageId/chatId
- **Fixed proxy support** — Honors per-account proxy dispatcher via undici fetch
- **Fixed skill commands** — Now scoped to bound agent per bot
- **Fixed account token lookup** — Normalized for non-normalized IDs

**2026.1.29 (Major update):**
- **Message editing** — You can now edit sent messages via `message(action="edit")`
- **Quote replies** — Support for quote replies in message tool and inbound context
- **Silent sends** — Optional silent flag to disable notifications
- **Sticker support** — Send/receive stickers with vision caching (stickers get sent to vision models)
- **Plugin channel data** — Support for plugin sendPayload with media/buttons
- **Caption param** — Added caption parameter for media sends
- **Topic IDs** — Kept in restart sentinel notifications

The big ones are **message editing**, **quote replies**, and **sticker support** — gives you more flexibility in how you interact via Telegram.
user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +2m 2026-02-01 20:51 PST] Can you check my Gmail and give me a list of the newsletters/emails I pretty much always delete?

user: [Telegram Joshua Bessom id:8527894183 +12m 2026-02-01 21:06 PST] Let’s try going with deepseek 3 on openrouter, with kimi k2.5 as fallback
