# 2026-02-06 - Session Notes

## Morning Briefing Issues (Fixed)

### Problems Found:
1. **Clippy refresh service had wrong path** - Was pointing to `/private/tmp/clippy` instead of `/Users/Josh/clippy-cli`
2. **Token not loading in cron** - Clippy wrapper wasn't exporting CLIPPY_TOKEN from cache
3. **Send script used old CLI name** - `clawdbot` instead of `openclaw`
4. **News showing HTML** - morning-rss.py wasn't stripping HTML properly

### Fixes Applied:
- Updated `clippy-wrapper.sh` to export CLIPPY_TOKEN from `~/.config/clippy/token-cache.json`
- Fixed `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clippy.refresh.plist` with correct path
- Updated `morning-briefing.sh` to use wrapper and morning-rss-json.py
- Changed `send-morning-briefing.sh` to use `openclaw` CLI
- Added CLIPPY_TOKEN to crontab environment

## Performance Report Scanning (Sweeney Todd)

### Task from Kanban:
- Check work email daily at 7am for Sweeney performance reports
- Extract Audio/Sound section from PDF attachments
- Catalog in Apple Note

### Scripts Created:
- `/Users/Josh/clawd/scripts/extract-pdf.sh` - Extracts Audio/Sound section from PDF, updates Apple Note
- `/Users/Josh/clawd/scripts/check-performance-reports.sh` - Daily checker, alerts when new reports arrive

### Limitation Discovered:
- Microsoft Graph API with current Clippy token scope doesn't allow attachment downloads (403 Forbidden)
- Browser automation fragile for Outlook PDF downloads
- **Current solution**: Semi-automated - alert on new reports, manual PDF download, then run extract script

### Cron Job Added:
```
0 7 * * * /Users/Josh/clawd/scripts/check-performance-reports.sh >> /Users/Josh/clawd/performance-check.log 2>&1
```
