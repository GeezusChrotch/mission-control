## Config Fix - OpenRouter Model Routing
Josh reported timeout errors and config issues with model routing. Fixed OpenClaw config to use OpenRouter exclusively:

### Model Setup (OpenRouter only)
- **Default**: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` (alias: `kimi`)
- **Coding tasks**: `openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.1` (alias: `coding`)
- **Heartbeat**: `openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku` (alias: `haiku`)
- **Subagents**: MiniMax M2.1 primary, Kimi/Sonnet fallbacks

### What Was Broken
- Config had direct Moonshot provider (`https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`) alongside OpenRouter
- Mixed fallback list caused auth confusion and timeouts
- Some models routing to Moonshot directly instead of through OpenRouter

### What Was Fixed  
- Removed direct Moonshot provider from `models.providers`
- Set `models.mode: "replace"` with empty providers (OpenRouter is built-in)
- Cleaned up `agents.defaults.models` to only use OpenRouter paths
- Simplified fallback chain to OpenRouter-only models

### Aliases Available
- `kimi` → Kimi K2.5
- `coding` → MiniMax M2.1
- `haiku` → Claude 3.5 Haiku  
- `sonnet` → Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- `opus` → Claude Opus 4.5
- `deepseek` → DeepSeek V2
- `grok` → Grok 4
- `gpt5` → GPT-5.2

Josh is on the **stable** update channel.

## Identity & Personality Update

### Name Change
- **Old**: Roboboogie
- **New**: Mr. Clawncy (dapper crab in top hat and monocle)

### SOUL.md Updates
Updated personality in SOUL.md:
- Sarcastic (but still helpful)
- Dark sense of humor — life's absurd, might as well laugh
- Leftist politics — solidarity over hierarchy, people over profits
- Vegan — "no ethical consumption under capitalism, but you still try"

### Telegram Bot
- Changed name to Mr. Clawncy via @BotFather
- Set dapper crab avatar (top hat + monocle)

## Messaging Configuration

### Voice/TTS
- Enabled auto-voice responses for Telegram (ElevenLabs)
- Decided it was too slow (2-5 second delay) — disabled auto-voice
- Kept TTS available on demand via tool
- Josh uses Mac Whisper locally for voice input, reads text replies

### iMessage Signature
- Added response prefix to all messages: `—Mr. Clawncy 🤖\n\n`
- This identifies AI messages clearly when sent from Josh's account

## Morning Briefing

### First Run
- Successfully sent morning briefing via iMessage to jbessom@me.com
- Includes: weather, work/personal email counts, calendar events, Mission Control tasks, news, OpenRouter usage
- Scheduled to run daily at 6 AM
