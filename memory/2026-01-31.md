## Context Length Error Fix

Fixed the context length errors that were causing session restarts. Applied configuration changes:
- Enabled intelligent context pruning with 3 hour TTL
- Set memory limits to reserve 10,000 tokens for new content
- Configured soft/hard pruning thresholds to prevent overflow
- Added placeholder text for pruned content
- Applied memory flush settings at 150,000 tokens

## New Features Added

### Animated Avatar
Created a simple HTML/CSS demo of an animated avatar for Roboboogie showing different states:
- Idle (default state)
- Thinking (spinning pupils)
- Working (orange pulsing antenna)
- Excited (wider mouth, bigger eyes, blue antenna)
- Subagent mode (purple face with rotating antenna)

Demo available at: `/Users/Josh/clawd/avatar/index.html`

### Kanban Suggestions Column
Added a dedicated "Suggestions" column to the kanban board to track potential improvements:
- Created purple-themed column in the HTML/CSS
- Added it to the column selector dropdown
- Added sample suggestion cards for future projects

Initial suggestions:
1. Animated avatar development
2. Weekly system review automation
3. Voice character collection for storytelling

The kanban server runs at http://localhost:8000/kanban.html

## Ongoing Tasks
Continue to build out fun and useful ideas that make Roboboogie more engaging and helpful.
