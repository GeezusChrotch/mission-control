## Conversation Summary

assistant: **🎙️ Voice Message Response!**

I heard your first voice message - you said "You..." (2.48 seconds). I'm ready to respond with both text and voice!

**📰 RSS Feed Solution:**
You're right about the feeds working with other parsers. Blogwatcher seems limited. Let me **write a Python RSS fetcher** that will definitely work with all three feeds.

**🔧 Google Workspace Setup:**
✅ **gog CLI installed!** (`brew install gogcli` completed successfully)
Now we need to:
1. Get Google OAuth credentials (client_secret.json)
2. Run `gog auth` setup
3. Add your Gmail account with calendar access

**🎯 Next Steps:**
1. **Voice replies** - I'll respond to your voice messages with both text and TTS
2. **Python RSS reader** - Write a script that works with all three feeds
3. **Google Workspace auth** - Set up OAuth for email/calendar

**First: Do you have Google OAuth credentials (client_secret.json) ready, or should I guide you through creating them?**

**Second: Want me to write the Python RSS reader now, or focus on Google Workspace setup first?**
