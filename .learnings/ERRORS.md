## [ERR-20260202-001] openclaw-liveavatar-token-mismatch

**Logged**: 2026-02-02T23:09:00Z
**Priority**: high
**Status**: pending
**Area**: infra

### Summary
LiveAvatar fails to connect to OpenClaw Gateway with "token_mismatch" error despite providing correct token via OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN environment variable.

### Error
```
unauthorized conn=xxx reason=token_mismatch
reason=unauthorized: gateway token mismatch
```

### Context
- OpenClaw Gateway running with token authentication enabled
- Token in config: c42c95ffb81c515fd5ef4a4ff44ade352a654a674e1c9eca
- LaunchAgent service has token in EnvironmentVariables
- LiveAvatar started with: `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=xxx openclaw-liveavatar`
- Multiple gateway processes were running simultaneously (caused additional confusion)

### Environment
- macOS 26.3 (arm64)
- OpenClaw 2026.1.30
- LiveAvatar via npm package (openclaw-liveavatar)

### Attempted Fixes
1. Set OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN environment variable before running LiveAvatar
2. Added token to ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json skills.entries.liveavatar.env
3. Killed duplicate gateway processes
4. Restarted gateway service
5. Passed token via `env OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=xxx openclaw-liveavatar`

### Suggested Fix
- LiveAvatar may not be reading the OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN environment variable correctly
- Check LiveAvatar source code for how it reads gateway token
- Consider adding token as command-line argument or config file
- May be a bug in openclaw-liveavatar package

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json, ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
