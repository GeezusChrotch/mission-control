## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.
